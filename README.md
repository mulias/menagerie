# Menagerie

All of my programing language projects are named after animals. ~~They are all broken and sad, just like the animals at a real zoo.~~ I'm keeping all these projects in one place because they don't serve much purpose outside of helping me work through PL concepts.

## Marmot

The first one! I had just finished a systems class using a lot of C, so programming in a language that is a lot like C but more convenient sounded like fun. PL clulessness aside, I fell into the trap of trying to use Go's channels/threads/whatever they're called in places where I really shouldn't have. A huge wreck, not worth trying to clean up.


## Llama

Another 'just learning a language' project, this time with OCaml. I was still working through some basic PL concepts, so this is another attempt to make a Lisp using a metacircular evaluation method, Ã  la SICP. Has all the important basic stuff, but there's not enough framework to do anything interesting. Abandoned.


## Catbird

OCaml again, Lispy again (scheme). This time I knew enough to get somewhere. I dropped off this project right in the middle of messing around with monads. Worth revisiting.


## Shrimp

A little thingy I did to decompress from finals. simply typed lambda calculus, with the goal of seeing how far I could get in one sitting. It's written as a ruby object, so you can embed little lambda calc functions into a ruby program! 


## Up Next

I should wrap up Catbird and Shrimp. Need to actually add type checking to Shrimp. Whatever I start next will hopefully be more ML like and less lispy.
